									D6-StarWars-Character-Sheet
									===========================

This is the Character sheet for the D6-Based  WEG Star Wars and the new D6 Star Wars games. The sheet is geared to 2E and REUP as the rolls use wild die, but the option to disable wild die and others are on the top upcoming improvement.

List your dice and pips next to the appropriate skills -  3pips equal another die.
The text areas are expandable for additional info.
